This project provides an API to manage FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) with translation capabilities. The backend is built with **Express.js, MongoDB, Redis, and AWS Translate**. The system automatically translates questions and answers into multiple languages: **English, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, and Gujarati**. It also caches the translated content in Redis for efficient retrieval.
